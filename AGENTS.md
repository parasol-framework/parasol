## Build System and Common Commands

Parasol uses CMake for building. It can be built as either modular (shared libraries) or static libraries.

### Essential Build Commands

**Configure build:**
- Release: `cmake -S . -B build/agents -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=build/agents-install -DRUN_ANYWHERE=TRUE -DPARASOL_STATIC=ON -DBUILD_DEFS=ON -DENABLE_UNIT_TESTS=ON`
- Debug: `cmake -S . -B build/agents-debug -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=build/debug-install -DRUN_ANYWHERE=TRUE -DPARASOL_STATIC=ON -DENABLE_UNIT_TESTS=ON`
- Modular build: Use `-DPARASOL_STATIC=OFF` in the configuration.

**Build and install:**
- Build: `cmake --build build/agents --config [BuildType] --parallel`
- Install: `cmake --build build/agents --config [BuildType] --parallel && cmake --install build/agents`
- To build an individual module, append `--target [module]` to the build command, e.g. `--target network`.  In static builds, use `--target [module] parasol_cmd` to ensure that the parasol executable is rebuilt to include the changes.

**Testing:**
- **ALWAYS** install your latest build before running `ctest`.
- Run all integration tests: `ctest --build-config [BuildType] --test-dir build/agents --output-on-failure`
- Run single integration test: `ctest --build-config [BuildType] --test-dir build/agents --output-on-failure -L TEST_LABEL`
- **ALWAYS** write Fluid tests using Flute unless instructed otherwise (see Flute Testing section below)
- When running the Parasol executable for individual tests, **ALWAYS** append `--log-warning` at a minimum for log messages, or `--log-api` if more detail is required.  Log output is directed to stderr.
- Statements can be tested on the commandline with `--statement`, e.g. `parasol --statement "print('Hello')"`
- If modifying files in the `scripts` folder, **ALWAYS** append `--set-volume scripts=/absolute/path/to/parasol/scripts` to ensure your modified files are being loaded over the installed versions.

**Verify:**
- If a `build/agents` folder already exists, check if the configuration is `Release` or `Debug` before using it for the first time.
- You can inspect the version, git commit hash and build type of the build by running `parasol` with `--version`.

### CMake Configuration Options

Key build options (use with `-D` flag):
- `PARASOL_STATIC=ON/OFF` - Build as static libraries instead of modules
- `BUILD_TESTS=ON/OFF` - Enable/disable test building
- `BUILD_DEFS=ON/OFF` - Auto-generate C/C++ headers from FDL files
- `RUN_ANYWHERE=ON/OFF` - Build for local folder execution
- `PARASOL_VLOG=ON/OFF` - Enables trace level log messages in Debug builds (has no effect on Release builds).

### Development in the Cloud

When working in ephemeral cloud environments:

- Prefer the pre-created build tree at `build/agents` and install tree at `build/agents-install` to avoid the expense of repeated configuration.  If the directory exists you can immediately run `cmake --build build/agents --config [BuildType] --parallel`.
- If no `build/agents` folder exists, prefer to use the Debug configuration `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` for fast compiling speed.
- If you must reconfigure, clean only the affected cache entries with `cmake -S . -B build/agents -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=[BuildType] ...` rather than deleting the entire build tree.
- If `parasol` is not already installed at `build/agents-install` then performing the build and install process is essential if intending to run `parasol` for Fluid scripts and Flute tests.
- If configuring a build, disabling unnecessary modules like Audio and Graphics features (if they are not relevant) will speed up compilation.  If *certain* that the environment is cloud-based, you can consider including the following with your CMake build configuration: `-DDISABLE_AUDIO=ON -DDISABLE_X11=ON -DDISABLE_DISPLAY=ON -DDISABLE_FONT=ON`

## Architecture Overview

### Core Framework Structure

**Parasol Framework** is a vector graphics engine and application framework designed for creating scalable user interfaces. The framework automatically handles display resolution and scaling concerns, allowing developers to focus on application logic rather than display technicalities. Key architectural components include:

1. **Core System** (`src/core/`) - Base object system, memory management, filesystem, and module loading
2. **Vector Graphics Engine** (`src/vector/`) - Main graphics rendering system with scene graphs, filters, and painters
3. **SVG Support** (`src/svg/`) - W3C-compliant SVG parsing and rendering with SMIL animation
4. **Display Management** (`src/display/`) - Cross-platform window management, surfaces, and input handling
5. **Fluid Scripting** (`src/fluid/`) - An extensively modified Lua-based scripting environment built on LuaJIT
6. **Document Engine** (`src/document/`) - RIPL text layout engine for rich document rendering

### Module System

The framework uses a modular architecture where each major feature is implemented as a separate module:
- Each module is in `src/[module_name]/` with its own `CMakeLists.txt`
- Static builds link all modules into the core, while modular builds load them dynamically
- Module definitions are stored in `.fdl` files which generate C++ headers and module `MOD_IDL` strings

### Object System and FDL Files

Parasol uses Interface Definition Language (IDL) files with `.fdl` extension to generate documentation, include files and C++ stubs:
- FDL files define classes, methods, fields, and constants
- Build system generates C/C++ headers from FDL using tools in `tools/idl/`
- Class implementations are in `class_*.cpp` files
- Generated headers go to `include/parasol/` directory
- Headers are built by triggering a cmake build.

### Scripting Integration

**Fluid** is the integrated Lua-based scripting language:
- Unique engine built on LuaJIT 2.1 for performance and extensively modified for C++, utilising C++20 capabilities.
- Provides high-level access to all framework APIs
- GUI toolkit available through `scripts/gui/` modules (modular widget system)
- Test scripts use `.fluid` extension
- Declarative UI creation with automatic scaling and layout management
- Callback-driven architecture for event handling
- The Fluid object interface is case sensitive.  Object fields are accessed as lower snake-case names, e.g. `netlookup.hostName`
- Fluid scripts are executed with the `parasol` executable, which has a dependency on the project being built and installed.
- Fluid scripts execute top-to-bottom with NO entry point function
- Fluid APIs and reference manuals are available in multiple files at `docs/wiki/Fluid-*.md`.
- General API framework documentation in `docs/xml/modules` and `docs/xml/modules/classes` can be utilised to understand class and module interfaces in detail.

#### Fluid Features Additional to Lua

- `is` instead of `==`
- `continue` statement in loops
- Compound operators: `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=` on numeric values
- `..=` for string concatenation
- Postfix operators: `++`
- C-style bitwise operators: `&`, `|`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`
- C-style ternary operator: `condition ? true_val :> false_val`
- Falsey value checks with `??`, e.g. `if value?? then ...`
- `?=` and `??` conditional operators as a convenience for redefining falsey values, e.g. `result = value1 ?? value2`
- `defer() ... end` statement that runs code when de-scoped.
- `goto`, labels, `==` and `~=` are deprecated

#### Fluid Coding Patterns

**Always study existing examples first:**
```bash
# Key example files to examine:
examples/*.fluid          # Application examples
tools/docgen.fluid        # Process execution example
tools/*.fluid             # Build and utility scripts
scripts/gui/*.fluid       # GUI component examples
scripts/*.fluid           # APIs
```

## Key Development Patterns

### Flute Testing

Tests are written in Fluid and executed with the Flute test runner:
- Test files are typically named `test_*.fluid` in module directories.
- Read at least 3 Flute test files to learn the patterns before writing your first test file.
- Use `flute_test()` CMake function to register tests
- Tests run post-install against the installed framework
- Always use `--gfx-driver=headless` for CI/automated testing
- You can append `--log-api` to the runner to see log messages

**Flute Test Command Format:**

Working example when working from the root folder (recommended):

```bash
build/agents-install/parasol tools/flute.fluid file=src/network/tests/test_bind_address.fluid --log-warning
```

**Key Requirements for Flute Tests:**
- Use absolute path for the test file parameter (`file=...`) if not running from the root folder.

### Code Generation

The build system heavily uses code generation:
- FDL files are processed by `tools/idl/idl-c.fluid` to generate C headers
- `tools/idl/idl-compile.fluid` generates IDL definition strings
- Generated files are created in build directories and copied to `include/`
- Use `BUILD_DEFS=OFF` to skip generation if no Parasol executable is available

### Multi-Platform Considerations

- Core code is cross-platform (Windows/Linux/MacOS)
- Platform-specific code is in subdirectories (`win32/`, `x11/`, etc.)
- Build system auto-detects platform capabilities (X11, SSL, etc.)
- Windows builds support both MSVC and MinGW toolchains

**Windows-Specific Notes:**
- In Bash commands, quote paths with spaces: `"path with spaces"`
- For Flute tests, use relative paths for executables to avoid path separator issues

## Working with Vector Graphics

The vector graphics system is the core of Parasol and provides unique capabilities:
- **API-accessible scene graphs** - Hierarchical scene graphs specifically for vector graphics with full programmatic access
- **SVG-to-scene graph integration** - SVG files are parsed directly into manipulable scene graphs for real-time modification
- **Resolution independence** - All graphics scale automatically across display resolutions and DPI settings
- Filters provide effects like blur, lighting, and color manipulation
- Painters handle gradients, patterns, and image fills
- Animation support includes SMIL (SVG animation) and custom VFX
- Real-time manipulation of individual scene graph nodes for dynamic graphics

**Distinctive Features:**
Parasol maintains retained scene graphs that can be modified at runtime. This enables dynamic, scalable graphics where individual elements can be manipulated programmatically.

## Development Guidelines

### ⚠️ CRITICAL PROJECT REQUIREMENTS (Override Standard C++ Practices)

**These rules MUST be followed and override common C++ conventions:**

- **NEVER use `static_cast`** - Use C-style casting instead, e.g. `int(variable)` NOT `static_cast<int>(variable)`
- **NEVER use `&&`** - Use `and` instead of `&&`
- **NEVER use `||`** - Use `or` instead of `||`
- **NEVER use `==`** - Use the `IS` macro instead of `==` (exceptions made for operator overloading)
- **NEVER use C++ exceptions** - Error management relies on checking function results

### 📋 MANDATORY CODING CHECKLIST

Before considering ANY C++ code changes complete, verify:

- [ ] All `&&` replaced with `and`
- [ ] All `||` replaced with `or`
- [ ] All `==` replaced with `IS` macro
- [ ] All `static_cast` replaced with C-style casts
- [ ] No C++ exceptions used
- [ ] All trailing whitespace removed
- [ ] Code compiles successfully
- [ ] Follows formatting standards below

For Fluid code, verify:

- [ ] All `~=` replaced with `!=`
- [ ] All `==` replaced with `is`
- [ ] All trailing whitespace removed

### Additional Code Style Standards

- Always use upper camel-case for the names of function arguments in C++ and Fluid code.
- Always use lower snake_case for the names of variables inside C++ and Fluid functions.
- Use three spaces for tabulation in C++ and Fluid code.
- C++ functions that use global variables must be written with thread safety in mind.
- New and refactored code must target modern C++20 conventions and functionality.
- C++ global variable names are prefixed with `gl` and written in upper camel-case, e.g. `glSomeVariable`
- The default column width is 120 characters for all languages and markdown files.
- Always default to British English spelling in code and comments.
- For C++ `if`, `while`, `else`, `for`, `switch` and `struct` keywords, the opening curly brace must be on the same line if no word-wrapping has occurred.

### Testing

**MANDATORY: Always compile after making C++ changes**
- After making changes to C++ source files, you MUST verify compilation by building the affected module(s)
- This is required before considering any code changes complete
- There is a dependency on `parasol_cmd` being built by cmake in order to make the `parasol` executable available to run tests.

**Full Build Commands:**
```bash
# Build everything
cmake --build build/agents --config [BuildType] --parallel

# Install after successful build
cmake --install build/agents
```

**Module Build Commands:**
```bash
# Build specific module (e.g., network, vector, svg, etc.)
cmake --build build/agents --config [BuildType] --target [module_name] --parallel

# Examples:
cmake --build build/agents --config [BuildType] --target network --parallel    # For network changes
```

### Documentation

- API documentation is embedded within comment sections of the C++ source files.
- Embedded documentation is identified with markers in the format `-MARKER-` whereby `MARKER` describes a section for the document generator to parse.
- Marked document sections are terminated at the end of their comment or when `-END-` is encountered.
- Embedded documentation for each function is identified by the `-FUNCTION-` marker.
- Embedded documentation for each class is identified by the `-CLASS-` marker.
- Classes can export actions and methods, which are documented with `-ACTION-` and `-METHOD-` markers.
- Embedded documentation for class fields are identified by the `-FIELD-` marker.
- Always use British English spelling in documentation, comments and variable names.

## File Organization

- `src/` - All source code organized by module
- `include/parasol/` - Public API headers (many auto-generated)
- `scripts/` - Fluid standard library and GUI toolkit
- `tools/` - Build tools and utilities (IDL processors, test runner)
- `examples/` - Example applications and demonstrations (examine git-tracked .fluid files for current examples)
- `data/` - Icons, fonts, styles, and configuration files
- `docs/wiki/` - Markdown files for the GitHub Wiki, includes practical tutorials and guides on how to use Parasol.
- `docs/html/` - Contains the entire Parasol website for offline viewing.
- `docs/xml/` - Auto-generated API documentation in XML format.  This content is sourced from the Parasol C++ files.
- `docs/plans/` - For storing and retrieving your plan files.

Lower snake-case is the preferred string format for new file names.

### Key Examples for Learning

- **`examples/widgets.fluid`** - Primary showcase of Parasol's GUI capabilities, demonstrates standard widgets and UI patterns
- **`examples/vue.fluid`** - File viewer supporting SVG, RIPL, JPEG, PNG - shows document and graphics integration
- **`examples/gradients.fluid`** - Interactive gradient editor demonstrating real-time vector graphics manipulation
- **`tools/http_server.fluid`** - HTTP server implementation with NetSocket usage patterns
- **`tools/idl/idl-c.fluid`** - Extensive file I/O and general API usage

## Agentic Behaviour

- Always give an honest, balanced opinion in your responses
- Encourage testing and validation of changes.  Analysis should be presented alongside evidence.
- If you are asked to do work that relates to a plan file, update the plan at the end of the session to indicate what was achieved.
