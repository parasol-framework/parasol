-CLASS-
XML: Provides an interface for the management of structured data.

The XML class is designed to provide robust functionality for creating, parsing and maintaining XML data structures.
It supports both well-formed and loosely structured XML documents, offering flexible parsing behaviours to
accommodate various XML formats.  The class includes comprehensive support for XPath 2.0 queries, content manipulation
and document validation.

The class has been designed in such a way as to accommodate other structured data formats such as JSON and YAML.  In
this way, the class not only provides XML support but also serves as Parasol's general-purpose structured
data handler.  It also makes it trivial to convert between different structured data formats, and benefit from
the cross-application use of features, such as applying XPath 2.0 queries on data originating from YAML.

<header>Data Loading and Parsing</header>

XML documents can be loaded into an XML object through multiple mechanisms:

The #Path field allows loading from file system sources, with automatic parsing upon initialisation.  The class
supports ~Core.LoadFile() caching for frequently accessed files, improving performance for repeated operations.

The #Statement field enables direct parsing of XML strings, supporting dynamic content processing and in-memory
document construction.

The #Source field provides object-based input, allowing XML data to be sourced from any object supporting the Read
action.

For batch processing scenarios, the #Path or #Statement fields can be changed post-initialisation, causing the XML
object to clear old data and parse the new.  This approach optimises memory usage by reusing existing object
instances rather than creating new ones.

<header>Document Structure and Access</header>

Successfully parsed XML data is accessible through the #Tags field, which contains a hierarchical array of !XMLTag
structures.  Each XMLTag represents a complete XML element including its attributes, content and child elements.
The structure maintains the original document hierarchy, enabling both tree traversal and direct element access.

C++ developers benefit from direct access to the Tags field, represented as `pf::vector&lt;XMLTag&gt;`.  This provides
efficient iteration and element access with standard STL semantics.  Altering tag attributes is permitted and methods
to do so are provided in the C++ header for `objXML` and `XMLTag`, with additional functions in the `xml` namespace.
Check the header for details.

Fluid developers need to be aware that reading the #Tags field generates a copy of the entire tag structure - it
should therefore be read only as needed and cached until the XML object is modified.

<header>Not Supported</header>

DTD processing and validation is intentionally not supported.  While the class can parse DOCTYPE declarations, it
does not load or  validate against external DTDs as this is now a legacy technology.  Use XML Schema (XSD) for
validation instead.

-ACTION-
DataFeed: Processes and integrates external XML data into the object's document structure.

The DataFeed action provides a mechanism for supplying XML content to the object from external sources or streaming
data.  This action supports both complete document replacement and incremental content addition, depending on the
current state of the XML object.

The action accepts data in XML or plain text format and automatically performs parsing and integration.  When the
object contains no existing content, the provided data becomes the complete document structure.  If the object already
contains parsed XML, the new data is parsed separately and appended to the existing tag hierarchy.

If the provided data contains malformed XML or cannot be parsed according to the current validation settings, the
action will return appropriate error codes without modifying the existing document structure.  This ensures that
partial parsing failures do not corrupt previously loaded content.

Attempts to feed data into a read-only XML object will be rejected to maintain document integrity.

Example:

<code>
local xml = obj.new('xml')
local err = xml.acDataFeed(nil, DATA_XML, '<first>First element</first>')
</code>

-METHOD-
Filter: Filters the XML data structure to retain only a specific tag and its descendants.

The Filter method provides a mechanism for reducing large XML documents to a specific subtree, permanently removing

performance optimisation when working with large documents where only a specific section is relevant.

The filtering process begins by locating the target element using the provided XPath expression.  Once found, a
new XML structure is created containing only the matched tag and its complete descendant hierarchy.  All sibling
tags, parent elements (excluding the direct lineage) and unrelated branches are permanently discarded.

-METHOD-
FindTag: Searches for XML elements using XPath expressions with optional callback processing.

The FindTag method provides the primary mechanism for locating XML elements within the document structure using
XPath 2.0 compatible expressions.  The method supports both single-result queries and comprehensive tree traversal
with callback-based processing for complex operations.

When no callback function is provided, FindTag returns the first matching element and terminates the search
immediately.  This is optimal for simple queries where only the first occurrence is required.

When a callback function is specified, FindTag continues searching through the entire document structure, calling the
provided function for each matching element.  This enables comprehensive processing of all matching elements in a
single traversal.

The C++ prototype for Callback is `ERR Function(*XML, XMLTag &Tag, CSTRING Attrib)`.

The callback should return `ERR::Okay` to continue processing, or `ERR::Terminate` to halt the search immediately.
All other error codes are ignored to maintain search robustness.

Note: If an error occurs, check the #ErrorMsg field for a custom error message containing further details.

-METHOD-
GetAttrib: Retrieves the value of a specific XML attribute from a tagged element.

The GetAttrib method provides efficient access to individual attribute values within XML elements.  Given a tag
identifier and attribute name, the method performs a case-insensitive search through the element's attribute
collection and returns the corresponding value.

When a specific attribute name is provided, the method searches through all attributes of the target tag.  The search
is case-insensitive to accommodate XML documents with varying capitalisation conventions.

When the attribute name is NULL or empty, the method returns the tag name itself, providing convenient access to
element names without requiring separate API calls.

<header>Performance Considerations</header>

For applications requiring frequent attribute access or high-performance scenarios, C++ developers should consider
direct access to the !XMLAttrib structure array.  This bypasses the method call overhead and provides immediate
access to all attributes simultaneously.

The method performs a linear search through the attribute collection, so performance scales with the number of
attributes per element.  For elements with many attributes, caching frequently accessed values may improve performance.

<header>Data Integrity</header>

The returned string pointer references internal XML object memory and remains valid until the XML structure is
modified.  Callers should not attempt to modify or free the returned string.  For persistent storage, the string
content should be copied to application-managed memory.

-INPUT-
int Index: The unique identifier of the XML tag to search.  This must correspond to a valid tag ID as returned by methods such as #FindTag().
cstr Attrib: The name of the attribute to retrieve (case insensitive).  If NULL or empty, the element's tag name is returned instead.
&cstr Value: Pointer to a string pointer that will receive the attribute value.  Set to NULL if the specified attribute does not exist.

-ERRORS-
Okay: The attribute was successfully found and its value returned.
NullArgs: Required arguments were not specified correctly.
NotFound: Either the specified tag Index does not exist, or the named attribute was not found within the tag.

-METHOD-
GetContent: Extracts the immediate text content of an XML element, excluding nested tags.

The GetContent method provides efficient extraction of text content from XML elements using a shallow parsing approach.
It retrieves only the immediate text content of the specified element, deliberately excluding any text contained within
nested child elements.  This behaviour is valuable for scenarios requiring precise content extraction without
recursive tag processing.

Consider the following XML structure:

<pre>
&lt;body&gt;
  Hello
  &lt;bold&gt;emphasis&lt;/bold&gt;
  world!
&lt;/body&gt;
</pre>

The GetContent method would extract `Hello world!` and deliberately exclude `emphasis` since it is contained within the
nested `&lt;bold&gt;` element.

<header>Comparison with Deep Extraction</header>

For scenarios requiring complete text extraction including all nested content, use the #Serialise() method with
appropriate flags to perform deep content analysis.  The GetContent method is optimised for cases where nested tag
content should be excluded from the result.

If the resulting content exceeds the buffer capacity, the result will be truncated but remain null-terminated.

It is recommended that C++ programs bypass this method and access the !XMLAttrib structure directly.

Use SetKey to add tag attributes and content using XPaths.  The XPath is specified in the `Key` parameter and the data

It is not possible to add new tags using this action - it is only possible to update existing tags.

Please note that making changes to the XML tree will render all previously obtained tag pointers and indexes invalid.

The Sort method is used to sort a single branch of XML tags in ascending or descending order.  An `XPath` is required

The `Sort` parameter is used to specify a list of sorting instructions.  The format for the `Sort` string is
`Tag:Attrib,Tag:Attrib,...`.  The `Tag` indicates the tag name that should be identified for sorting each node, and
child tags are supported for this purpose.  Wildcard filtering is allowed and a `Tag` value of `*` will match every
tag at the requested `XPath` level.  The optional `Attrib` value names the attribute containing the sort string.  To
sort on content, do not define an `Attrib` value (use the format `Tag,Tag,...`).

-INPUT-
cstr XPath: Sort everything under the specified tag, or `NULL` to sort the entire top level.
cstr Sort: Pointer to a sorting instruction string.

-METHOD-
ValidateDocument: Validate the XML document against the currently loaded schema.

This method performs structural and simple type validation of the document using
the loaded XML Schema.  The Result parameter returns `1` when the document
conforms to the schema, otherwise `0`.

-ERRORS-
Okay: Validation completed successfully.
NullArgs: The Result parameter was not supplied.
NoSupport: No schema has been loaded for this XML object.
NoData: The XML document does not contain any parsed tags.
Search: The schema does not define the root element present in the document.
-END-
