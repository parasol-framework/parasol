-CLASS-
Audio: Supports a machine's audio hardware and provides a client-server audio management service.

The Audio class provides a comprehensive audio service that works across multiple platforms and follows a client-server
design model. It serves as the foundation for all audio operations in the Parasol framework, managing hardware resources,
sample mixing, and output buffering.

The Audio class supports 8/16/32 bit output in stereo or mono configurations, with advanced features including oversampling
for enhanced quality, intelligent streaming for large samples, multiple simultaneous audio channels, and command sequencing
for precise timing control. The internal floating-point mixer ensures high-quality audio processing regardless of the
target hardware bit depth.

For straightforward audio playback requirements, we recommend using the @Sound class interface, which provides a
simplified API whilst utilising the Audio class internally. Direct use of the Audio class is appropriate for
applications requiring precise mixer control, multiple simultaneous samples, or custom audio processing workflows.

Note: Support for audio recording is not currently available in this implementation.

-ACTION-
Activate: Enables access to the audio hardware and initialises the mixer.

An audio object must be activated before it can play audio samples. The activation process involves several critical steps:
hardware resource acquisition, mixer buffer allocation, and platform-specific driver initialisation.

Activation attempts to gain exclusive or shared access to the audio hardware device. On some platforms, this may fail if
another process has obtained an exclusive lock on the audio device. The specific behaviour depends on the underlying
audio system (ALSA on Linux, DirectSound on Windows).

If activation fails, the audio object remains in an inactive state but retains its configuration. Common failure
causes include hardware device unavailability, insufficient system resources, or driver compatibility issues.

All resources and device locks obtained during activation can be released through #Deactivate(). An inactive audio
object can perform configuration operations but cannot process audio samples.

-ERRORS-
Okay: Hardware activation completed successfully.
AllocMemory: Failed to allocate internal mixing buffers.
Failed: Hardware device unavailable or driver initialisation failed.

-METHOD-
AddSample: Adds a new sample to an audio object for channel-based playback.

Audio samples can be loaded into an Audio object for playback via the AddSample() or #AddStream() methods.  For small
samples under 512k we recommend AddSample(), while anything larger should be supported through #AddStream().

When adding a sample, it is essential to select the correct bit format for the sample data.  While it is important to
differentiate between simple attributes such as 8 or 16 bit data, mono or stereo format, you should also be aware of
whether or not the data is little or big endian, and if the sample data consists of signed or unsigned values.  Because
of the possible variations there are a number of sample formats, as illustrated in the following table:

!SFM

By default, all samples are assumed to be in little endian format, as supported by Intel CPU's.  If the data is in big
endian format, logical-or the SampleFormat value with `SFM::F_BIG_ENDIAN`.

It is also possible to supply loop information with the sample data.  This is achieved by configuring the !AudioLoop
structure:

!AudioLoop

The types that can be specified in the `LoopMode` field are:

!LOOP

The `Loop1Type` and `Loop2Type` fields alter the style of the loop.  These can be set to the following:

!LTYPE

-INPUT-
func OnStop: This optional callback function will be called when the stream stops playing.
int(SFM) SampleFormat: Indicates the format of the sample data that you are adding.
buf(ptr) Data: Points to the address of the sample data.
bufsize DataSize: Size of the sample data, in bytes.
struct(*AudioLoop) Loop: Optional sample loop information.
structsize LoopSize: Must be set to `sizeof(AudioLoop)` if `Loop` is defined.
&int Result: The resulting sample handle will be returned in this parameter.

-ERRORS-
Okay: Sample successfully added to the audio system.
Args: Invalid argument values provided.
NullArgs: Required parameters are null or missing.

/*********************************************************************************************************************

-METHOD-
AddStream: Adds a new sample-stream to an Audio object for channel-based playback.

Use AddStream to load large sound samples to an Audio object, allowing it to play those samples on the client
machine without over-provisioning available resources.  For small samples under 256k consider using #AddSample()
instead.

The data source used for a stream will need to be provided by a client provided `Callback` function.  The prototype
is `INT callback(INT SampleHandle, INT Offset, UINT8 *Buffer, INT BufferSize)`.

The `Offset` reflects the retrieval point of the decoded data and is measured in bytes.  The `Buffer` and
`BufferSize` reflect the target for the decoded data.  The function must return the total number of bytes that were
written to the `Buffer`. If an error occurs, return zero.

When creating a new stream, pay attention to the audio format that is being used for the sample data.
It is important to differentiate between 8-bit, 16-bit, mono and stereo, but also be aware of whether or not the data
is little or big endian, and if the sample data consists of signed or unsigned values.  Because of the possible
variations there are a number of sample formats, as illustrated in the following table:

!SFM

By default, all samples are assumed to be in little endian format, as supported by Intel CPU's.  If the data is in big
endian format, logical-or the `SampleFormat` value with the flag `SFM::F_BIG_ENDIAN`.

It is also possible to supply loop information with the stream.  The Audio class supports a number of different looping
formats via the !AudioLoop structure:

!AudioLoop

There are three types of loop modes that can be specified in the `LoopMode` field:

!LOOP

The `Loop1Type` and `Loop2Type` fields normally determine the style of the loop, however only unidirectional looping is
currently supported for streams.  For that reason, set the type variables to either `LTYPE::NIL` or
`LTYPE::UNIDIRECTIONAL`.

-INPUT-
func Callback: This callback function must be able to return raw audio data for streaming.
func OnStop: This optional callback function will be called when the stream stops playing.
int(SFM) SampleFormat: Indicates the format of the sample data that you are adding.
int SampleLength: Total byte-length of the sample data that is being streamed.  May be set to zero if the length is infinite or unknown.
int PlayOffset: Offset the playing position by this byte index.
struct(*AudioLoop) Loop: Refers to sample loop information, or `NULL` if no loop is required.
structsize LoopSize: Must be set to `sizeof(AudioLoop)`.
&int Result: The resulting sample handle will be returned in this parameter.

-ERRORS-
Okay: Stream successfully configured and added to the audio system.
Args: Invalid argument values provided.
NullArgs: Required parameters are null or missing.
AllocMemory: Failed to allocate the stream buffer.

SetVolume: Sets the volume for input and output mixers.

To change volume and mixer levels, use the SetVolume method.  It is possible to make adjustments to any of the
available mixers and for different channels per mixer - for instance you may set different volumes for left and right
speakers.  Support is also provided for special options such as muting.

To set the volume for a mixer, use its index or set its name (to change the master volume, use a name of `Master`).

A target `Channel` such as the left `0` or right `1` speaker can be specified.  Set the `Channel` to `-1` if all
channels should be the same value.

The new mixer value is set in the `Volume` field.

Optional flags may be set as follows:

<types lookup="SVF"/>

-INPUT-
int Index: The index of the mixer that you want to set.
cstr Name: If the correct index number is unknown, the name of the mixer may be set here.
int(SVF) Flags: Optional flags.
int Channel: A specific channel to modify (e.g. `0` for left, `1` for right).  If `-1`, all channels are affected.
double Volume: The volume to set for the mixer, from 0 to 1.0.  If `-1`, the current volume values are retained.

<li><b>Maximum</b>: 16 periods (enables extensive buffering for demanding applications)</li>
<li><b>Recommended</b>: 4 periods (balances latency and reliability for most use cases)</li>

The PeriodSize field determines the granularity of audio buffer management, affecting system responsiveness, processing
efficiency, and overall audio quality. This setting works in conjunction with the #Periods field to define the complete
buffering architecture.

<list type="bullet">
<li><b>Minimum</b>: 1024 bytes (1KB) - Enables very low latency but requires high-performance processing.</li>
<li><b>Maximum</b>: 16384 bytes (16KB) - Provides maximum buffering and processing time per period.</li>
<li><b>Recommended</b>: 2048 bytes (2KB) - Optimal balance for most applications and hardware configurations.</li>
</list>

Period latency (in seconds) = `PeriodSize ÷ (SampleRate × Channels × BytesPerSample)`

For example, with a 2048-byte period at 44100Hz stereo 16-bit `Latency = 2048 ÷ (44100 × 2 × 2) = 11.6ms per period`

The combination of PeriodSize and #Periods creates a multi-stage buffering system where audio data flows through
sequential periods, providing time for processing whilst maintaining continuous playback.

The value range spans from 0 (minimal processing) to 100 (maximum fidelity), with recommended settings between 70-80
for most applications. This range provides an optimal balance between audio clarity and system performance.

Setting the Quality value automatically adjusts the following processing flags:

<list type="bullet">
<li><b>Quality 0-9</b>: Minimal processing, no filtering or oversampling applied.</li>
<li><b>Quality 10-32</b>: Enables `ADF::FILTER_LOW` for basic output filtering.</li>
<li><b>Quality 33-65</b>: Activates `ADF::FILTER_HIGH` for enhanced frequency response.</li>
<li><b>Quality 66-100</b>: Implements `ADF::OVER_SAMPLING` and `ADF::FILTER_HIGH` for maximum fidelity.</li>
</list>
