<!--
This test has a gradient with gradientUnits='objectBoundingBox' which is a fade from black to white.
The gradient is used for the stroke of a line. Vertical and horizontal lines don't have a boundingbox,
since they are one-dimensional, even though the stroke-width makes it look like they should have a
boundingbox with non-zero width and height.

See the coordinate chapter, last paragraph of 7.11 "Keyword objectBoundingBox should not be used when
the geometry of the applicable element has no width or no height, such as the case of a horizontal or
vertical line, even when the line has actual thickness when viewed due to having a non-zero stroke
width since stroke width is ignored for bounding box calculations. When the geometry of the applicable
element has no width or height and objectBoundingBox is specified, then the given effect (e.g., a
gradient or a filter) will be ignored."

The left rectangle has four 'line' elements rotated in different ways. The stroke for the lines have a green solid stroke fallback which
should be used if the gradient should be ignored. For this sub-test to pass there must be three lines with solid green stroke, and one line
(from bottom left to top right) with a gradient stroke, visible in the rectangle.

The right rectangle is the same as the left rectangle except that the stroke paintservers don't have a fallback specified.
For this sub-test to pass only the line from bottom left to top right must be visible in the rectangle, and it must have a gradient stroke.
