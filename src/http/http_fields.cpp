A timeout for send and receive operations is required to prevent prolonged waiting during data transfer operations.

When streaming downloaded content to an object, the default datatype is `RAW` (binary mode).  An alternative is to

The receiving object can identify the data as HTTP information by checking the class ID of the sender.

Write content to the `Buffer` and the final size will determine the amount of data sent to the server.
Alternatively use the Write() action, although this will be less efficient.

For scripting languages the function prototype is `function(HTTP)`.  Use the Write() action to send data
