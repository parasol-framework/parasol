<h1>Parasol Framework</h1>

<p>Parasol is a FOSS vector engine and application sandbox. An integrated scripting language based on Lua helps to simplify application development without compromising on speed or modern features.  Alternatively you can integrate the framework with your preferred environment if it supports linking with standard system libraries.</p>

<p>Parasol's ongoing development is focused on enhancing vector graphics programming on the desktop. We believe that this a research area that has been historically under-valued, but this needs to change with more displays achieving resolutions at 4K and beyond.  Apart from the scalability of vector graphics, we're also hoping to experiment with more dynamic rendering features that aren't possible with traditional bitmap interfaces.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Fully integrated Lua scripting in our Fluid development environment.</li>
<li>Load and save SVG files.  Manipulate or create new vector scene graphs from scratch using our API that also includes feature enhancements not available in SVG.</li>
<li>Multi-platform compatible networking API, providing coverage for TCP/IP Sockets, HTTP, SSL.</li>
<li>Scalable widgets for UI development (windows, checkboxes, buttons, dialogs, text and a great deal more...).</li>
<li>Data handling APIs (XML, JSON, ZIP, PNG, JPEG, SVG)</li>
<li>Full system abstraction for multi-platform support (file I/O, clipboards, threads, object management)</li>
<li>Multi-channel audio playback</li>
<li>Extensive text editing widget (implemented with scintilla.org)</li>
</ul>

<p>Optional extensions not included with the main distribution:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cryptography support (AES)</li>
<li>Database connectivity (MySQL, SQLite)</li>
</ul>
