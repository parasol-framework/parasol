    <description>
<p>Vector is an abstract class that is used as a blueprint for other vector classes that provide specific functionality for a vector scene.  At this time the classes are <class name="VectorClip">VectorClip</class>, <class name="VectorEllipse">VectorEllipse</class>, <class name="VectorGroup">VectorGroup</class>, <class name="VectorPath">VectorPath</class>, <class name="VectorPolygon">VectorPolygon</class>, <class name="VectorRectangle">VectorRectangle</class>, <class name="VectorSpiral">VectorSpiral</class>, <class name="VectorText">VectorText</class>, <class name="VectorViewport">VectorViewport</class> and <class name="VectorWave">VectorWave</class>.</p>
<p>The majority of sub-classes support all of the functionality provided by Vector.  The general exception is that graphics functions will not be supported by non-graphical classes, for instance <class name="VectorGroup">VectorGroup</class> and <class name="VectorViewport">VectorViewport</class> do not produce a vector path and therefore cannot be rendered.</p>
<p>To simplify the creation of complex vector graphics and maximise compatibility, we have designed the vector management code to use data structures that closely match SVG definitions.  For this reason we do not provide exhaustive documentation on the properties that can be applied to each vector type.  Instead, please refer to the SVG reference manuals from the W3C.  In cases where we are missing support for an SVG feature, assume that future support is intended unless otherwise documented.</p></description>

<p>The InputSubscription method is provided as an extension to gfxSubscribeInput(), whereby the user's input events will be filtered down to those that occur within the vector's graphics area only.  The original events are transferred as-is, although the <code>ENTERED_SURFACE</code> and <code>LEFT_SURFACE</code> events are modified so that they trigger during passage through the vector boundaries.</p>

<p>Call NewMatrix() to allocate a transformation matrix that allows transforms to be applied to a vector.  Manipulating the transformation matrix is supported by functions in the Vector module, such as <function module="Vector">Scale</function> and <function module="Vector">Rotate</function>.</p>
<p>Note that if multiple matrices are allocated by the client, they will be applied to the vector in the order of their creation.</p>
<p>The structure will be owned by the Vector object and is automatically terminated when the Vector is destroyed.  If the transform is no longer required before then, it can be manually removed with @FreeMatrix().</p>

<p>This method provides an accurate means of determining if a specific coordinate is inside the path of a vector.

      <description>
<p>This method moves the position of a vector within its branch of the vector stack.  Repositioning is relative to the current position of the vector.  Every unit specified in the Position parameter will move the vector by one index in the stack frame.  Negative values will move the vector backwards; positive values move it forward.</p>
<p>It is not possible for an vector to move outside of its branch, i.e. it cannot change its parent.  If the vector reaches the edge of its branch with excess units remaining, the method will return immediately with an ERR_Okay error code.</p>

      <description>
<p>Any vector that generates a path can be traced by calling this method.  Tracing allows the caller to follow the path for each pixel that would be drawn if the path were to be rendered with a stroke size of 1.  The prototype of the callback function is <code>ERROR Function(OBJECTPTR Vector, LONG Index, LONG Command, DOUBLE X, DOUBLE Y)</code>.</p>
<p>The Vector parameter refers to the vector targeted by the method.  The Index is an incrementing counter that reflects the currently plotted point.  The X and Y parameters reflect the coordinate of a point on the path.</p>
<p>If the Callback returns ERR_Terminate, then no further coordinates will be processed.</p>

      <description>
<p>The InnerJoin value is used to make very technical adjustments to the way that paths are stroked when they form corners.  Visually, the impact of this setting is only noticeable when a path forms an awkward corner that crosses over itself - usually due to the placement of bezier control points.</p>
<p>The available settings are MITER, ROUND, BEVEL, JAG and INHERIT.  The default of MITER is recommended as it is the fastest, but ROUND produces the best results in ensuring that the stroked path is filled correctly.  The most optimal approach is to use the default setting and switch to ROUND if issues are noted near the corners of the path.</p>

<p>When two line segments meet at a sharp angle and miter joins have been specified in <field>LineJoin</field>, it is possible for the miter to extend far beyond the thickness of the line stroking the path. The MiterLimit imposes a limit on the ratio of the miter length to the <field>StrokeWidth</field>. When the limit is exceeded, the join is converted from a miter to a bevel.</p>
<p>The ratio of miter length (distance between the outer tip and the inner corner of the miter) to <field>StrokeWidth</field> is directly related to the angle (theta) between the segments in user space by the formula: <code>MiterLength / StrokeWidth = 1 / sin ( theta / 2 )</code>.</p>
<p>For example, a miter limit of 1.414 converts miters to bevels for theta less than 90 degrees, a limit of 4.0 converts them for theta less than approximately 29 degrees, and a limit of 10.0 converts them for theta less than approximately 11.5 degrees.</p>

      <name>Morph</name>
      <comment>Enables morphing of the vector to a target path.</comment>
      <access read="G" write="S">Get/Set</access>
      <type>OBJECTPTR</type>
      <description>
<p>If the Morph field is set to a Vector object that generates a path, the vector will be morphed to follow the target vector's path shape.  This works particularly well for text and shapes that follow a horizontal path that is much wider than it is tall.</p>
<p>Squat shapes will fare poorly if morphed, so experimentation may be necessary to understand how the morph feature is best utilised.</p>

      <description>
<p>The Sequence is a string of points and instructions that define the path.  It is based on the SVG standard for the path element <code>d</code> attribute, but also provides some additional features that are present in the vector engine.  Commands are case insensitive.</p>
<p>The following commands are supported:</p>
<pre>M: Move To
L: Line To
V: Vertical Line To
H: Horizontal Line To
Q: Quadratic Curve To
T: Quadratic Smooth Curve To
C: Curve To
S: Smooth Curve To
A: Arc
Z: Close Path
</pre>
<p>The use of lower case characters will indicate that the provided coordinates are relative (based on the coordinate of the previous command).</p>

      <type>ARRAY</type>
      <description>
<p>The colour that will be used in stroking a path is defined by the StrokeColour field.  The colour is composed of 4 floating point values comprising Red, Green, Blue and Alpha.  The intensity of each colour component is determined by a value range between 0 and 1.0.  If the Alpha value is zero, a coloured stroke will not be applied when drawing the vector.</p>
<p>This field is complemented by the <field>StrokeOpacity</field> and <field>Stroke</field> fields.</p>

      <access read="G" write="S">Get/Set</access>
      <type>DOUBLE</type>
      <description>
<p>The StrokeOpacity value expresses the opacity of a path stroke as a value between 0 and 1.0.  A value of zero would render the stroke invisible and the maximum value of one would render it opaque.</p>
<p>Please note that thinly stroked paths may not be able to appear as fully opaque in some cases due to anti-aliased rendering.</p>

<p>The StrokeWidth defines the pixel width of a path when it is stroked.  If this field is set to zero, the path will not be stroked.</p>
<p>The StrokeWidth is affected by scaling factors imposed by transforms and viewports.</p>
