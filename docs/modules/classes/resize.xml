    <description>
<p>The Resize class is used for declaring user-interactive resizing areas.  In most cases it is applied to the edges of <class name="Surface">Surface</class> objects so that the user can drag the edge to a new location.  When creating a new Resize object, you can choose the edges of the surface border that should be monitored for resizing, or alternatively you may pin-point the resizing area through standard dimension specifications.  The following example demonstrates the use of both methods:</p>
<pre>surface = obj.new('surface', {
   x=50, y=70, width=250, height=300
})
surface.new('resize', {
   border='left|right|top|bottom',
   bordersize=10
})
surface.new('resize', {
   xoffset=10, yoffset=10, width=20, height=20,
   direction='all'
})
</pre>
<p>The first Resize object monitors all four sides of the surface, within an area that does not exceed 10 units on either edge.  The second Resize object monitors an area that is 20x20 units in size at an offset of 10 units from the bottom right edge.  The <field>Direction</field> field has been set to a value of <code>all</code>, which means that the user can resize the surface area in any direction by interacting with the Resize object.</p>
<p>When using Resize objects to manage the dimensions of a surface, it is recommended that the MinWidth, MinHeight, MaxWidth and MaxHeight fields are used to prevent excessive shrinkage or expansion.  These values must be set in the <class name="Surface">Surface</class> object that the resize functionality is being applied to.</p></description>

<p>Use the Border field to declare the surface edges that will be user-interactive.  If not defined on initialisation, the specific dimensions for a single monitored area should be provided instead.</p>
<p>The size of the borders that are to be monitored must be set through the <field>BorderSize</field> field.</p>

<p>By default, the user can interact with a resizeable area by moving the mouse over it and pressing/holding the left mouse button or its UI equivalent.  To change the button that the UI responds to, set the Button field to a different value. Valid settings are JET_LMB, JET_RMB and JET_MMB.</p>

      <description>
<p>If using a Resize object to monitor a specific region rather than using the <field>Border</field> functionality, it is necessary to declare the directions in which the user is allowed to apply the resize.  Setting a direction such as <code>UP|LEFT</code> would allow the user to resize towards the top left corner of the display, but not the bottom right corner.</p>
<p>Note that if the <field>Border</field> field has been defined then the Direction is ignored.</p>
