    <description>
<p>The VectorScene class acts as a container and control point for the management of vector definitions.  Its primary duty is to draw the scene to a target Bitmap provided by the client.</p>
<p>Vector scenes are created by initialising multiple Vector objects such as <class name="VectorPath">VectorPath</class> and <class name="VectorViewport">VectorViewport</class> and positioning them within a vector tree.  The VectorScene must lie at the root.</p>
<p>To simplify the creation of complex vector graphics and maximise compatibility, we have designed the vector management code to use data structures that provide a very close match to SVG.  For this reason we do not provide exhaustive documentation on the properties that can be applied to each vector type.  Instead, please refer to the SVG reference manuals from the W3C.  In cases where we are missing support for an SVG feature, we most likely intend to support that feature unless otherwise documented.</p>
<p>To draw a scene, the client must set the target <field>Bitmap</field> and call the <action>Draw</action> action.</p>
<p>Vector definitions can be saved and loaded from permanent storage by using the <class name="SVG">SVG</class> class.</p></description>

<p>This method will add a new definition to the root of a vector tree.  This feature is provided with the intention of supporting SVG style references to definitions such as gradients, images and other vectors.  By providing a name with the definition object, the object can then be referenced in strings that support definition referencing.</p>
<p>For instance, creating a gradient and associating it with the definition "redGradient" it would be possible to reference it with the string "url(#redGradient)" from common graphics attributes such as "fill".</p>

<p>This method will search a scene for an object that matches a given ID (vector ID's can be set with the NumericID and ID fields).  If multiple vectors are using the same ID, repeated calls can be made to this method to find all of them. This is achieved by calling this method on the vector that was last returned as a result.</p>
<p>Please note that searching for string-based ID's is achieved by converting the string to a case-sensitive hash with StrHash() and using that as the ID.</p>

<p>RenderTime returns the rendering time of the last scene that was drawn, measured in microseconds.  This value can also be used to compute the frame-per-second rate as '1000000 / RenderTime'.</p>
<p>The RENDER_TIME flag should also be set before fetching this value, as it is required to enable the timing feature.  If RENDER_TIME is not set, it will be set automatically so that subsequent calls succeed correctly.</p>

      <description>
<p>The SampleMethod controls the sampling algorithm that is used when images and patterns in the vector definition are affected by rotate, skew and scale transforms.  The choice of method will have a significant impact on the speed and quality of the images that are displayed in the rendered scene.  The recommended default is BILINEAR, which provides a comparatively average result and execution speed.  The most advanced method is BLACKMAN8, which produces an excellent level of quality at the cost of very poor execution speed.</p>

<p>The first object in the vector scene is referenced here.  It must belong to the VectorViewport class, because it will be used to define the size and location of the area rendered by the scene.</p>
<p>The Viewport field must not be set by the client.  The VectorViewport object will configure its ownership to the VectorScene prior to initialisation.  The Viewport field value will then be set automatically when the VectorViewport object is initialised.</p>
