    <description>
<p>The ComboBox class is used to create combo boxes, also known as 'drop-down menus' in application interfaces.  A combobox typically looks like a text entry area, but features a button positioned to the right-hand side of the gadget. Clicking on the button will pop-up a menu that the user can use to select a pre-defined menu item.  Clicking on one of those items will paste the item text into the combobox.</p>
<p>A crucial feature of the combobox is the drop-down menu.  The combobox uses the <class name="Menu">Menu</class> class to support its menu construction. To add items to the drop-down menu, you need to pass instructions to it using XML.  You can learn more about the XML specification in the <class name="Menu">Menu</class> class manual.</p>
<p>When the user selects a combobox item, you may need to respond with an action.  You can do this by initialising child objects to the combobox. These will be executed when the combobox is activated.  When programming, you can also subscribe to the combobox's Activate action and write a customised response routine.</p>
<p>The id of the most recently selected menu item can be retrieved from the <field>SelectedID</field> field.</p>
<p>To make modifications to the menu after initialisation, read the <field>Menu</field> field and manipulate it directly.</p></description>

      <type>STRING</type>
      <description>
<p>A label can be drawn next to the combobox area by setting the Label field.  The label should be a short, descriptive string of one or two words.  It is common practice for the label to be followed with a colon character.</p>

      <description>
<p>If you set a label for the combobox, the width of the label area is automatically calculated according to the width of the label string.  You may override this behaviour by setting a value in the LabelWidth field.</p>

      <description>
<p>The surface area that represents the combobox display can be accessed through this field.  For further information, refer to the Surface class.  Note that interfacing with the surface directly can have adverse effects on the combobox control system.  Where possible, all communication should be limited to the combobox object itself.</p>
      </description>

    <field>
      <name>Right</name>
      <comment>The right-most coordinate of the combobox (X + Width).</comment>
      <access read="G">Get</access>
      <type>INT</type>
    </field>

    <field>
      <name>SelectedID</name>
      <comment>Returns the menu ID of the selected combobox item.</comment>
      <access read="G">Get</access>
      <type>INT</type>
      <description>
<p>This field returns the menu ID of the selected combobox item.  This requires that an id is set for each configured menu item (the 'id' attribute).</p>
<p>Menu ID's are not guaranteed to be unique.  It is your responsibility to assign ID's and ensure that they are unique to prevent an ID from matching multiple items.</p>
<p>If the combobox text does not reflect one of the available menu items, then the returned value will be -1.  If the selected menu item has no identifier, the default return value is 0.</p>
      </description>
    </field>

    <field>
      <name>String</name>
      <comment>The string that is to be printed inside the combobox is declared here.</comment>
      <access read="G" write="S">Get/Set</access>
      <type>STRING</type>
      <description>
<p>The string that you would like to be displayed in the combobox is specified in this field.  The string must be in UTF-8 format and may not contain line feeds.  You can read this field at any time to determine what the user has entered in the combobox.</p>
<p>If the string is changed after initialisation, the combobox will be redrawn to show the updated text.  No feedback notification will be sent as a result of updating this field manually.</p>
      </description>
    </field>

    <field>
      <name>Surface</name>
      <comment>The surface that will contain the combobox graphic.</comment>
      <access read="R" write="W">Read/Write</access>
      <type>OBJECTID</type>
      <description>
<p>The surface that will contain the combobox graphic is set here.  If this field is not set prior to initialisation, the combobox will attempt to scan for the correct surface by analysing its parents until it finds a suitable candidate.</p>
      </description>
    </field>

    <field>
      <name>TabFocus</name>
      <comment>Set this field to a TabFocus object to register the combobox in a tab-list.</comment>
      <access write="S">Set</access>
      <type>OBJECTID</type>
      <description>
<p>The TabFocus field provides a convenient way of adding the combobox to a <class name="TabFocus">TabFocus</class> object, so that it can be focussed on via the tab key.  Simply set this field to the ID of the <class name="TabFocus">TabFocus</class> object that is managing the tab-list for the application window.</p>
      </description>
    </field>

    <field>
      <name>TextInput</name>
      <comment>The text control object created for the combobox is referenced here.</comment>
      <access read="R">Read</access>
      <type class="Text">*Text</type>
      <description>
<p>The text object that is referenced here manages the display and editing of text inside the combobox area. Characteristics of the text object can be defined prior to initialisation, although we recommend that this be done from the combobox style definition.</p>
<p>The face and point size of the text is set by the widget styling code and therefore cannot be changed through the TextInput object directly.</p>

      <access read="G" write="S">Get/Set</access>
      <type>DOUBLE</type>
      <description>
<p>A combobox can be given a fixed or relative width by setting this field to the desired value.  To set a relative width, use the FD_PERCENT flag when setting the field.</p>
      </description>
    </field>

    <field>
      <name>X</name>
      <comment>The horizontal position of a combobox.</comment>
      <access read="G" write="S">Get/Set</access>
      <type>DOUBLE</type>
      <description>
<p>The horizontal position of a combobox can be set to an absolute or relative coordinate by writing a value to the X field.  To set a relative/percentage based value, you must use the FD_PERCENT flag or the value will be interpreted as fixed.  Negative values are permitted.</p>
      </description>
    </field>

    <field>
      <name>XOffset</name>
      <comment>The horizontal offset of a combobox.</comment>
      <access read="G" write="S">Get/Set</access>
      <type>DOUBLE</type>
      <description>
<p>The XOffset has a dual purpose depending on whether or not it is set in conjunction with an X coordinate or a Width based field.</p>
<p>If set in conjunction with an X coordinate then the combobox will be drawn from that X coordinate up to the width of the container, minus the value given in the XOffset.  This means that the width of the ComboBox is dynamically calculated in relation to the width of the container.</p>
<p>If the XOffset field is set in conjunction with a fixed or relative width then the combobox will be drawn at an X coordinate calculated from the formula <code>X = ContainerWidth - ComboBoxWidth - XOffset</code>.</p>

      <type>DOUBLE</type>
      <description>
<p>The vertical position of a ComboBox can be set to an absolute or relative coordinate by writing a value to the Y field.  To set a relative/percentage based value, you must use the FD_PERCENT flag or the value will be interpreted as fixed.  Negative values are permitted.</p>
      </description>

      <type>DOUBLE</type>
      <description>
<p>The YOffset has a dual purpose depending on whether or not it is set in conjunction with a Y coordinate or a Height based field.</p>
<p>If set in conjunction with a Y coordinate then the combobox will be drawn from that Y coordinate up to the height of the container, minus the value given in the YOffset.  This means that the height of the combobox is dynamically calculated in relation to the height of the container.</p>
<p>If the YOffset field is set in conjunction with a fixed or relative height then the combobox will be drawn at a Y coordinate calculated from the formula <code>Y = ContainerHeight - ComboBoxHeight - YOffset</code>.</p>
