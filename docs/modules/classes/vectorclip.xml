    <description>
<p>The VectorClip defines a clipping path that can be used by other vectors as a mask.  The clipping path is defined by creating Vector shapes that are initialised to the VectorClip as child objects.</p>
<p>Any Vector that defines a path can utilise a VectorClip by referencing it through the Vector's Mask field.</p>
<p>VectorClip objects must always be owned by their relevant <class name="VectorScene">VectorScene</class> or <class name="VectorViewport">VectorViewport</class>.  It is valid for a VectorClip to be shared by multiple vector objects within the same scene.</p></description>

<p>The default coordinate system for clip-paths is <code>BOUNDING_BOX</code>, which positions the clipping region against the vector that references it.  The alternative is <code>USERSPACE</code>, which positions the path relative to the current viewport.</p>
