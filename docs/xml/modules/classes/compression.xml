<p>The Compression class provides an interface to compress and decompress data.  It provides support for file based compression as well as memory based compression routines.  The base class uses zip algorithms to support pkzip files, while other forms of compressed data can be supported by installing additional compression sub-classes.</p>
<p>The following examples demonstrate basic usage of compression objects in Fluid:</p>
<pre>// Create a new zip archive and compress two files.

cmp = obj.new('compression', { path='temp:result.zip', flags='!NEW' } )
err = cmp.mtCompressFile('config:defs/compression.def', '')
err = cmp.mtCompressFile('config:defs/core.def', '')

// Decompress all *.def files in the root of an archive.

cmp = obj.new('compression', { path='temp:result.zip' } )
err = cmp.mtDecompressFile('*.def', 'temp:')
</pre>
<p>It is strongly advised that Compression objects are created for the purpose of either writing to, or reading from the target archive.  The class is not designed for both purposes simultaneously, particularly due to considerations for maximising operational speed.</p>
<p>If data is to be encrypted or decrypted, set the <fl>Password</fl> field with a null-terminated encryption string. If the password for an encrypted file, errors will be returned when trying to decompress the information (the source archive may be reported as a corrupted file).</p>
<p>To list the contents of an archive, use the <method>Scan</method> method.</p>
<p>To adjust the level of compression used to pack each file, set the <fl>CompressionLevel</fl> field to a value between 0 and 100%.</p>
<p>This code is based on the work of Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler.</p></description>

      <description>
<p>This method provides a simple way of compressing a memory area into a buffer.  It requires a reference to the source data and a buffer large enough to accept the compressed information.  Generally the destination buffer should be no smaller than 75% of the size of the source data.  If the destination buffer is not large enough, an error of <code>ERR::BufferOverflow</code> will be returned.  The size of the compressed data will be returned in the Result parameter.</p>
<p>To decompress the data that is output by this function, use the <method>DecompressBuffer</method> method.</p>
<p>The compression method used to compress the data will be identified in the first 32 bits of output, for example, <code>ZLIB</code>.  The following 32 bits will indicate the length of the compressed data section, followed by the data itself.</p>

<p>The CompressFile method is used to add new files and folders to a compression object. The client must supply the <code>Location</code> of the file to compress, as well as the <code>Path</code> that is prefixed to the file name when it is in the compression object.  The <code>Location</code> parameter accepts wildcards, allowing multiple files to be processed in a single function call.</p>
<p>To compress all contents of a folder, specify its path in the <code>Location</code> parameter and ensure that it is fully qualified by appending a forward slash or colon character.</p>
<p>The <code>Path</code> parameter must include a trailing slash when targeting a folder, otherwise the source file will be renamed to suit the target path.  If the <code>Path</code> starts with a forward slash and the source is a folder, the name of that folder will be used in the target path for the compressed files and folders.</p>

      <description>
<p>Use the CompressStream method to compress incoming streams of data whilst using a minimal amount of memory.  The compression process is handled in three phases of Start, Compress and End.  The methods provided for each phase are <method>CompressStreamStart</method>, <method>CompressStream</method> and <method>CompressStreamEnd</method>.</p>
<p>A compression object can manage only one compression stream at any given time.  If it is necessary to compress multiple streams at once, create a compression object for each individual stream.</p>
<p>No meta-information is written to the stream, so the client will need a way to record the total number of bytes that have been output during the compression process. This value must be stored somewhere in order to decompress the stream correctly.  There is also no header information recorded to identify the type of algorithm used to compress the stream.  We recommend that the compression object's sub-class ID is stored for future reference.</p>
<p>The following C code illustrates a simple means of compressing a file to another file using a stream:</p>
<pre>if (auto error = mtCompressStreamStart(compress); error IS ERR::Okay) {
   LONG len;
   LONG cmpsize = 0;
   UBYTE input[4096];
   while ((error = acRead(file, input, sizeof(input), &amp;len)) IS ERR::Okay) {
      if (!len) break; // No more data to read.

      error = mtCompressStream(compress, input, len, &amp;callback, NULL, 0);
      if (error != ERR::Okay) break;

      if (result &gt; 0) {
         cmpsize += result;
         error = acWrite(outfile, output, result, &amp;len);
         if (error != ERR::Okay) break;
      }
   }

   if (error IS ERR::Okay) {
      if ((error = mtCompressStreamEnd(compress, NULL, 0)) IS ERR::Okay) {
         cmpsize += result;
         error = acWrite(outfile, output, result, &amp;len);
      }
   }
}
</pre>
<p>Please note that, depending on the type of algorithm, this method will not always write data to the output buffer.  The algorithm may store a copy of the input and wait for more data for efficiency reasons.  Any unwritten data will be resolved when the stream is terminated with <method>CompressStreamEnd</method>.  To check if data was output by this function, either set a flag in the callback function or compare the <fl>TotalOutput</fl> value to its original setting before CompressStream was called.</p>

<p>Use the DecompressFile() method to decompress a file or files to a destination folder.  The exact path name of the compressed file is required for extraction unless using wildcards.  A single asterisk in the Path parameter will extract all files in a compression object.</p>
<p>When specifying the <code>Dest</code> parameter, it is recommended that you specify a folder location by using a forward slash at the end of the string.  If this is omitted, the destination will be interpreted as a file name.  If the destination file already exists, it will be overwritten by the decompressed data.</p>

<p>Call DecompressStream repeatedly to decompress a data stream and process the results in a callback routine.  The client will need to provide a pointer to the data in the <code>Input</code> parameter and indicate its size in <code>Length</code>.  The decompression routine will call the routine that was specified in <code>Callback</code> for each block that is decompressed.</p>
<p>The format of the <code>Callback</code> routine is <code>ERR Function(*Compression, APTR Buffer, LONG Length)</code></p>
<p>The <code>Buffer</code> will refer to the start of the decompressed data and its size will be indicated in <code>Length</code>.  If the <code>Callback</code> routine returns an error of any kind, the decompression process will be stopped and the error code will be immediately returned by the method.</p>
<p>Optionally, the client can specify an output buffer in the <code>Output</code> parameter.  This can be a valuable optimisation technique, as it will eliminate the need to copy data out of the compression object's internal buffer.</p>
<p>When there is no more data in the decompression stream or if an error has occurred, the client must call <method>DecompressStreamEnd</method>.</p>

<p>This method deletes compressed files from a compression object.  If the file is in a folder then the client must specify the complete path in conjunction with the file name.  Wild cards are accepted if you want to delete multiple files.  A <code>Path</code> setting of <code>*</code> will delete an archive's entire contents, while a more conservative <code>Path</code> of <code>documents/ *</code> would delete all files and directories under the documents path.  Directories can be declared using either the back-slash or the forward-slash characters.</p>

      <name>ArchiveName</name>
      <comment>Apply an archive name to the object, allowing it to be used as a named object in the file system.</comment>
      <access write="S">Set</access>
      <type>STRING</type>
      <description>
<p>Setting the ArchiveName will allow a Compression object's files to be accessible using standard file system paths. This is achieved through use of the <code>archive:</code> volume, which is a virtual filesystem included in the Core API.</p>

      <name>CompressionLevel</name>
      <comment>The compression level to use when compressing data.</comment>
      <access read="R" write="S">Read/Set</access>
      <type>INT</type>
      <description>
<p>The level of compression that is used when compressing data is determined by the value in this field.  Values range between 0 for no compression and 100 for maximum compression.  The speed of compression decreases with higher values, but the compression ratio will improve.</p>

    <field>
      <name>Feedback</name>
      <comment>Provides feedback during the de/compression process.</comment>
      <access read="G" write="S">Get/Set</access>
      <type>FUNCTION</type>
      <description>
<p>To receive feedback during any de/compression process, set a callback routine in this field. The format for the callback routine is <code>ERR Function(*Compression, *CompressionFeedback)</code>.</p>
<p>For object classes, the object that initiated the de/compression process can be learned by calling the Core's <function module="Core">CurrentContext</function> function.</p>
<p>During the processing of multiple files, any individual file can be skipped by returning <code>ERR::Skip</code> and the entire process can be cancelled by returning <code>ERR::Terminate</code>.  All other error codes are ignored.</p>
<p>The <st>CompressionFeedback</st> structure consists of the following fields:</p>

    <field>
      <name>MinOutputSize</name>
      <comment>Indicates the minimum output buffer size that will be needed during de/compression.</comment>
      <access read="R">Read</access>
      <type>INT</type>
      <description>
<p>This field indicates the minimum allowable buffer size for output during decompression and compression processing. This field must be checked before allocating your own buffers for holding compressed and decompressed output, as failing to allocate enough buffer space is extremely likely to result in overflow errors.</p>
      </description>

    <field>
      <name>Output</name>
      <comment>Resulting messages will be sent to the object referred to in this field.</comment>
      <access read="R" write="I">Read/Init</access>
      <type>OBJECTID</type>
      <description>
<p>If this field is set to a valid object ID, text messages will be sent to that object when the compression object is used.  This can be helpful for notifying the user of the results of compression, decompression and removal of files.</p>
<p>The target object must be capable of processing incoming text from data channels.</p>
      </description>
    </field>

    <field>
      <name>Password</name>
      <comment>Required if an archive needs an encryption password for access.</comment>
      <access read="G" write="S">Get/Set</access>
      <type>STRING</type>
      <description>
<p>Set the Password field if an archive will use a password for the encryption of its contents.  The string must be null-terminated and not more than 128 bytes in length.</p>
<p>It is recommended that the Password is set before or immediately after initialisation.  To change the password of an existing archive, create a new compression object with the desired password and transfer the existing data across to it.</p>
      </description>
    </field>

    <field>
      <name>Path</name>
      <comment>Set if the compressed data originates from, or is to be saved to a file source.</comment>
      <access read="G" write="S">Get/Set</access>
      <type>STRING</type>
      <description>
<p>To load or create a new file archive, set the Path field to the path of that file.</p>

    <field>
      <name>Permissions</name>
      <comment>Default permissions for decompressed files are defined here.</comment>
      <access read="R" write="W">Read/Write</access>
      <type lookup="PERMIT">PERMIT</type>
      <description>
<p>By default the permissions of files added to an archive are derived from their source location.  This behaviour can be over-ridden by setting the Permissions field.  Valid permission flags are outlined in the <class name="File">File</class> class.</p>

    <field>
      <name>Size</name>
      <comment>Indicates the size of the source archive, in bytes.</comment>
      <access read="G">Get</access>
      <type>INT64</type>
    </field>

    <field>
      <name>TotalOutput</name>
      <comment>The total number of bytes that have been output during the compression or decompression of streamed data.</comment>
      <access read="R">Read</access>
      <type>INT64</type>
    </field>

    <field>
      <name>UncompressedSize</name>
      <comment>The total decompressed size of all files in an archive.</comment>
      <access read="G">Get</access>
      <type>INT64</type>
      <description>
<p>If you would like to know the total number of bytes that have been compressed into a compression object, read this field.  This will tell you the maximum byte count used if every file were to be decompressed.  Header and tail information that may identify the compressed data is not included in the total.</p>

    <field>
      <name>WindowBits</name>
      <comment>Special option for certain compression formats.</comment>
      <access read="R" write="S">Read/Set</access>
      <type>INT</type>
      <description>
<p>The WindowBits field defines the size of the sliding window frame for the default compression format (DEFLATE), but may also be of use to other compression formats that use this technique.</p>
<p>For DEFLATE compression, the window bits range must lie between 8 and 15.  Please note that if the value is negative, the algorithm will not output the traditional zlib header information.</p>
<p>To support GZIP decompression, please set the WindowBits value to 47.</p>
