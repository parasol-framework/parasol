<p>The Picture class provides a standard API for programs to load picture files of any supported data type.  It is future proof in that future data formats can be supported by installing class drivers on the user's system.</p>
<p>The default file format for loading and saving pictures is PNG.  Other formats such as JPEG are supported via sub-classes, which can be loaded into the system at boot time or on demand.  Some rare formats such as TIFF are also supported, but user preference may dictate whether or not the necessary driver is installed.</p>
<header>Technical Notes</header>
<p>To find out general information about a picture before initialising it, <action>Query</action> it first so that the picture object can load initial details on the file format.</p>
<p>Images are also remapped automatically if the source palette and destination palettes do not match, or if there are significant differences between the source and destination bitmap types.</p></description>

      <description>
<p>In order to load an image file into a picture object you will need to Activate it after initialisation.  So long as the <field>Path</field> field refers to a recognised image file, it will be loaded into the picture object and the fields will be filled out to reflect the image content.</p>
<p>If you have preset the values of certain fields prior to activation, you will be placing restrictions on the image file that is to be loaded.  For example, if the source image is wider than a restricted Bitmap Width, the image will have its right edge clipped.  The same is true for the Bitmap Height and other restrictions apply to fields such as the Bitmap Palette.</p>
<p>Once the picture is loaded, the image data will be held in the picture's Bitmap object.  You can draw to and from the Bitmap using its available drawing methods.</p>

      <description>
<p>Objects that belong to the Picture class can be initialised in two possible ways.  If you have not set the <field>Path</field> field or have chosen to use the <code>NEW</code> flag, the initialisation routine will create a <field>Bitmap</field> area that contains no image data.  This allows you to fill the picture with your own image data and save it using the <action>SaveImage</action> or <action>SaveToObject</action> actions.  You must set the bitmap width, height and colour specifications at a minimum, or the initialisation process will fail.</p>
<p>If you have set the <field>Path</field> field and avoided the <code>NEW</code> flag, the initialisation process will analyse the file location to determine whether or not the data is in fact a valid image file.  If the file does not match up with a registered data format, an error code of <code>ERR_NoSupport</code> is returned.  You will need to use the Activate or Query actions to load or find out more information about the image format.</p>

<p>The details of a picture's graphical image and data are defined in its associated bitmap object.  It contains information on the image dimensions and palette for example.  The Palette can be preset if you want to remap the source image to a specific set of colour values.</p>

<p>The DisplayWidth and DisplayHeight fields define the preferred pixel dimensions to use for the display when viewing the image in a 96DPI environment.  Both fields will be set automatically when the picture source is loaded.  If the source does not specify a suitable value for these fields, they may be initialised to a value based on the picture's <field>Bitmap</field> Width and Height.</p>
<p>In the case of a scalable image source such as SVG, the DisplayWidth and DisplayHeight can be pre-configured by the client, and the loader will scale the source image to the preferred dimensions on load.</p>

<p>The Header field is a pointer to a 32 byte buffer that contains the first 32 bytes of information read from a picture file on initialisation.  This special field is considered to be helpful only to developers writing add on components for the picture class.</p>
<p>The buffer that is referred to by the Header field is not populated until the Init action is called on the picture object.</p>

      <description>
<p>If a source picture includes a mask, the Mask field will refer to a Bitmap object that contains the mask image once the picture source has been loaded.  The mask will be expressed as either a 256 colour alpha bitmap, or a 1-bit mask with 8 pixels per byte.</p>
<p>If creating a picture from scratch that needs to support a mask, set the <code>MASK</code> flag prior to initialisation and the picture class will allocate the mask bitmap automatically.</p>

      <description>
<p>The quality level to use when saving the image is defined here.  The value is expressed as a percentage between 0 and 100%, with 100% being of the highest quality.  If the picture format is loss-less, such as PNG, then the quality level may be used to determine the compression factor.</p>
<p>In all cases, the impact of selecting a high level of quality will increase the time it takes to save the image.</p>
