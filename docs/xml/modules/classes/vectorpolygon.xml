    <description>
<p>The VectorPolygon class provides support for three different types of vector:</p>
<list type="sorted">
<li>Closed-point polygons consisting of at least 3 points.</li>
<li>Open polygons consisting of at least 3 points (a 'polyline' in SVG).</li>
<li>Single lines consisting of two points only (a 'line' in SVG).</li>
</list>
<p>To create a polyline, set the <fl>Closed</fl> field to <code>false</code>.</p>
<p>To create a line, set the <fl>Closed</fl> field to <code>false</code> and set only two points (<fl>X1</fl>,<fl>Y1</fl>) and (<fl>X2</fl>,<fl>Y2</fl>)</p></description>

      <description>
<p>Set the Closed field to <code>true</code> to ensure that the polygon is closed between the start and end points.  This behaviour is the default.  If <code>false</code>, the polygon will not be closed, which results in the equivalent of the SVG polyline type.</p>

      <description>
<p>The author's computation of the total length of the path, in user units. This value is used to calibrate the user agent's own distance-along-a-path calculations with that of the author. The user agent will scale all distance-along-a-path computations by the ratio of PathLength to the user agent's own computed value for total path length.  This feature potentially affects calculations for text on a path, motion animation and various stroke operations.</p>

      <description>
<p>The Points field can be set with a series of <code>(X, Y)</code> coordinates that will define the polygon's shape.  A minimum of two numbered pairs will be required to define a valid polygon.  Each point must be separated with either white-space or a comma.</p>

      <comment>A series of numbered pairs that define the polygon.</comment>

      <description>
<p>The PointsArray field can be set with a <st>VectorPoint</st> array that defines the shape of a polygon.  A minimum of two points is required for the shape to be valid.  The <st>VectorPoint</st> structure consists of the following fields:</p>
<struct lookup="VectorPoint"/>

      <description>
<p>TotalPoints is a read-only field value that reflects the total number of coordinates that have been set in the <fl>Points</fl> array.  The minimum value is 2.</p>

<p>This field defines the X coordinate of the first point of the polygon.  It is recommended that this field is only used when creating a VectorPolygon that will be used to draw a single line.</p>
<p>By default the value will be treated as a fixed coordinate.  Scaled values are supported if the value is a defined as a percentage.</p>
