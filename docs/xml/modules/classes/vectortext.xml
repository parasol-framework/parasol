<p>To create text along a path, set the <class name="Vector" field="Morph">Vector.Morph</class> field with a reference to any <class name="Vector">Vector</class> object that generates a path.  The following extract illustrates the SVG equivalent of this feature:</p>
<pre>&lt;defs&gt;
  &lt;path id="myTextPath2" d="M75,20 l100,0 l100,30 q0,100 150,100"/&gt;
&lt;/defs&gt;

&lt;text x="10" y="100" stroke="#000000"&gt;
  &lt;textPath xlink:href="#myTextPath2"/&gt;
&lt;/text&gt;
</pre>
<p>Support for bitmap fonts is included.  This feature is implemented by drawing bitmap characters to an internal <class name="VectorImage">VectorImage</class> and then rendering that to the viewport as a rectangular path.  It is recommended that this feature is only used for fast <code>1:1</code> rendering without transforms.  The user is otherwise better served through the use of scalable fonts.</p></description>

      <description>
<p>If a single value is provided, it represents the new relative X coordinate for the current text position for rendering the glyphs corresponding to the first character within this element or any of its descendants.  The current text position is shifted along the x-axis of the current user coordinate system by the provided value before the first character's glyphs are rendered.</p>
<p>If a series of values is provided, then the values represent incremental shifts along the x-axis for the current text position before rendering the glyphs corresponding to the first n characters within this element or any of its descendants. Thus, before the glyphs are rendered corresponding to each character, the current text position resulting from drawing the glyphs for the previous character within the current ‘text’ element is shifted along the X axis of the current user coordinate system by length.</p>
<p>If more characters exist than values, then for each of these extra characters: (a) if an ancestor Text object specifies a relative X coordinate for the given character via a <fl>DX</fl> field, then the current text position is shifted along the x-axis of the current user coordinate system by that amount (nearest ancestor has precedence), else (b) no extra shift along the x-axis occurs.</p>

<p>The painter used for filling a vector path can be defined through this field using SVG compatible formatting.  The string is parsed through the <function module="Vector">ReadPainter</function> function.  Please refer to it for further details on valid formatting.</p>
<p>It is possible to enable dual-fill painting via this field, whereby a second fill operation can follow the first by separating them with a semi-colon <code>;</code> character.  This feature makes it easy to use a common background fill and follow it with an independent foreground, alleviating the need for additional vector objects.  Be aware that this feature is intended for programmed use-cases and is not SVG compliant.</p>

      <access read="G" write="S">Get/Set</access>
      <type>STRING</type>
      <description>
<p>The FontSize is equivalent to the SVG <code>font-size</code> attribute and refers to the height of the font from the dominant baseline to the hanging baseline.  This would mean that a capitalised letter without accents should fill the entire vertical space defined by FontSize.</p>
<p>The default unit value of FontSize is in pixels at a resolution of 72 DPI.  This means that if the display is configured to a more common 96 DPI for instance, the actual pixel size on the display will be <code>FontSize * 72 / 96</code>. Point sizes are also measured at a constant ratio of <code>1/72</code> irrespective of display settings, and this may need to factor into precise size calculations.</p>
<p>Standard unit measurements such as <code>px</code>, <code>em</code> and <code>pt</code> are supported by appending them after the numeric value. 1em is equivalent to the 'default font size', which is typically 16px unless modified.</p>
<p>When retrieving the font size, the resulting string must be freed by the client when no longer in use.</p>

<p>Unique styles for a font can be selected through the FontStyle field.  Conventional font styles are <code>Bold</code>, <code>Bold Italic</code>, <code>Italic</code> and <code>Regular</code> (the default).  Because TrueType fonts can use any style name that the designer chooses such as <code>Thin</code>, <code>Narrow</code> or <code>Wide</code>, use <function module="Font">GetList</function> for a definitive list of available style names.</p>
<p>Errors are not returned if the style name is invalid or unavailable.</p>

      <type>DOUBLE</type>
      <description>
<p>The inline-size property allows one to set the wrapping area to a rectangular shape. The computed value of the property sets the width of the rectangle for horizontal text and the height of the rectangle for vertical text. The other dimension (height for horizontal text, width for vertical text) is of infinite length. A value of zero (the default) disables the creation of a wrapping area.</p>

<p>Applies supplemental rotation about the current text position for all of the glyphs in the text string.</p>
<p>If multiple values are provided, then the first number represents the supplemental rotation for the glyphs corresponding to the first character within this element or any of its descendants, the second number represents the supplemental rotation for the glyphs that correspond to the second character, and so on.</p>
<p>If more numbers are provided than there are characters, then the extra numbers will be ignored.</p>
<p>If more characters are provided than numbers, then for each of these extra characters the rotation value specified by the last number must be used.</p>
<p>If the attribute is not specified and if an ancestor 'text' or 'tspan' element specifies a supplemental rotation for a given character via a 'rotate' attribute, then the given supplemental rotation is applied to the given character (nearest ancestor has precedence). If there are more characters than numbers specified in the ancestor's 'rotate' attribute, then for each of these extra characters the rotation value specified by the last number must be used.</p>
<p>This supplemental rotation has no impact on the rules by which current text position is modified as glyphs get rendered and is supplemental to any rotation due to text on a path and to 'glyph-orientation-horizontal' or 'glyph-orientation-vertical'.</p>

<p>This property enables word-wrapping in which the text will conform to the path of a <class name="Vector">Vector</class> shape.  Internally this is achieved by rendering the vector path as a mask and then fitting the text within the mask without crossing its boundaries.</p>
