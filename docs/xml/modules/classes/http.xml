<p>The HTTP class provides a way of interacting with servers that support the HTTP protocol.  Supported HTTP methods include <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code>, <code>DELETE</code>, <code>COPY</code>, <code>MOVE</code>, <code>MKCOL</code> and more.  The following features are included:</p>
<list type="unsorted">
<li>Handling of errors and HTTP status codes.</li>
<li>Monitoring of the server communication process.</li>
<li>Data transfer monitoring.</li>
<li>Sending and receiving in chunks of data.</li>
<li>Background processing of all HTTP instructions.</li>
<li>Data streaming.</li>
<li>User authentication, either automated or with user login dialogs.</li>
</list>
<p>For information on command execution and a technical overview of HTTP processing, please refer to the <action>Activate</action> action.</p>
<header>Sending Content</header>
<p>There are a variety of ways to send content to a server when using methods such as <code>PUT</code> and <code>POST</code>.  Content can be sent from objects by setting the <fl>InputObject</fl> field.  To send content from files, set the <fl>InputFile</fl> field.  To send string content, use an <fl>InputFile</fl> location that starts with <code>string:</code> followed by the text to send.</p>
<header>Receiving Content</header>
<p>There are three possible methods for content download.  This first example downloads content to a temporary file for further processing:</p>
<pre>http = obj.new('http', {
   src        = 'http://www.parasol.ws/index.html',
   method     = 'get',
   outputFile = 'temp:index.html',
   stateChanged = function(HTTP, State)
      if (State == HGS::COMPLETED) then print(content) end
   end
})

http.acActivate()
</pre>
<p>This example uses data feeds to push the downloaded data to another object in text format:</p>
<pre>doc = obj.new('scintilla')
http = obj.new('http', {
   src        = 'http://www.parasol.ws/index.html',
   method     = 'get',
   dataFeed   = 'text'
   objectMode = 'datafeed'
   outputObject = doc
})
http.acActivate()
</pre>
<p>Note that the target object needs to support the datatype that you specify, or it will ignore the incoming data.  The default datatype is <code>RAW</code> (binary format), but the most commonly supported datatype is <code>TEXT</code>.</p>
<p>The third method is to use function callbacks.  Refer to the <fl>Incoming</fl> field for further information on receiving data through callbacks.</p>
<header>Progress Monitoring</header>
<p>Progress of a data transfer can be monitored through the <fl>Index</fl> field.  If the callback features are not being used for a data transfer, consider using a timer to read from the <fl>Index</fl> periodically.</p>
<header>SSL Support (HTTPS)</header>
<p>Secure sockets are supported and can be enabled by setting the <fl>Port</fl> to 443 prior to connection, or by using <code>https://</code> in URI strings.  Methods of communication remain unchanged when using SSL, as encrypted communication is handled transparently.</p></description>

      <comment>Executes an HTTP method.</comment>
      <prototype>ERR acActivate(*Object)</prototype>
      <description>
<p>This action starts an HTTP operation against a target server.  Based on the desired <fl>Method</fl>, an HTTP request will be sent to the target server and the action will immediately return whilst the HTTP object will wait for a response from the server.  If the server fails to respond within the time period indicated by the <fl>ConnectTimeout</fl>, the HTTP object will be deactivated (for further details, refer to the <action>Deactivate</action> action).</p>
<p>Successful interpretation of the HTTP request at the server will result in a response being received, followed by file data (if applicable). The HTTP response code will be stored in the <fl>Status</fl> field.  The HTTP object will automatically parse the response data and store the received values in the HTTP object as variable fields.  It is possible to be alerted to the complete receipt of a response by listening to the <fl>CurrentState</fl> field, or waiting for the Deactivate action to kick in.</p>
<p>Following a response, incoming data can be managed in a number of ways. It may be streamed to an object referenced by the <fl>OutputObject</fl> field through data feeds.  It can be written to the target object if the <fl>ObjectMode</fl> is set to <code>READ_WRITE</code>.  Finally it can be received through C style callbacks if the <fl>Incoming</fl> field is set.</p>
<p>On completion of an HTTP request, the <action>Deactivate</action> action is called, regardless of the level of success.</p>

      <prototype>ERR acDeactivate(*Object)</prototype>
      <description>
<p>Following the completion of an HTTP request, the Deactivate() action will be called internally to signal an end to the process.  By listening to the Deactivate action(), you are given the opportunity to respond to the end of an HTTP request.</p>
<p>If child objects are initialised to the HTTP object, they will be activated automatically.  This feature is provided to assist scripted usage of the HTTP object.</p>
<p>Active HTTP requests can be manually cancelled by calling the Deactivate() action at any time.</p>

      <access read="R" write="W">Read/Write</access>
      <type>DOUBLE</type>
      <description>
<p>The timeout for connect operations is specified here.  In the event of a timeout, the HTTP object will be deactivated and the <fl>Error</fl> field will be updated to a value of <code>ERR::TimeOut</code>.</p>
<p>The timeout value is measured in seconds.</p>

      <type>INT64</type>
      <description>
<p>HTTP servers will return a ContentLength value in their response headers when retrieving information.  This value is defined here once the response header is processed.  The ContentLength may be set to <code>-1</code> if the content is being streamed from the server.</p>
<p>Note that if posting data to a server with an <fl>InputFile</fl> or <fl>InputObject</fl> as the source, the <fl>Size</fl> field will have priority and override any existing value in ContentLength.  In all other cases the ContentLength can be set directly and a setting of <code>-1</code> can be used for streaming.</p>

      <access read="G" write="S">Get/Set</access>
      <type>STRING</type>
      <description>
<p>The ContentType should be set prior to sending a <code>PUT</code> or <code>POST</code> request.  If <code>NULL</code>, the default content type for <code>POST</code> methods will be set to <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>.  For <code>PUT</code> requests the default of <code>application/binary</code> will be applied.</p>

      <type lookup="HGS">HGS</type>
      <description>
<p>The CurrentState is a readable field that tracks the current state of the client in its relationship with the target HTTP server.  The default state is <code>READING_HEADER</code>.  Changes to the state can be monitored through the <fl>StateChanged</fl> field.</p>
<p>On completion of an HTTP request, the state will be changed to either <code>COMPLETED</code> or <code>TERMINATED</code>.</p>

      <comment>The data timeout value, relevant when receiving or sending data.</comment>
      <access read="R" write="W">Read/Write</access>
      <type>DOUBLE</type>
      <description>
<p>A timeout for send and receive operations is required to prevent prolonged waiting during data transfer operations. This is essential when interacting with servers that stream data with indeterminate content lengths.  It should be noted that a timeout does not necessarily indicate failure if the content is being streamed from the server (<fl>ContentLength</fl> is set to <code>-1</code>).</p>
<p>In the event of a timeout, the HTTP object will be deactivated and the <fl>Error</fl> field will be updated to a value of <code>ERR::TimeOut</code>.</p>
<p>The timeout value is measured in seconds.</p>

      <description>
<p>When streaming downloaded content to an object, the default datatype is <code>RAW</code> (binary mode).  An alternative is to send the data as <code>TEXT</code> or <code>XML</code> by changing the Datatype field value.</p>
<p>The receiving object can identify the data as HTTP information by checking the class ID of the sender.</p>

      <type>ERR</type>
      <description>
<p>On completion of an HTTP request, the most appropriate error code will be stored here.  If the request was successful then the value will be zero (<code>ERR::Okay</code>). It should be noted that certain error codes may not necessarily indicate failure - for instance, an <code>ERR::TimeOut</code> error may be received on termination of streamed content.  For genuine HTML error codes, see the <fl>Status</fl> field.</p>

      <description>
<p>If an HTTP <code>GET</code> request is executed, the Index field will reflect the number of bytes that have been received. This field is updated continuously until either the download is complete or cancelled.</p>
<p>The Index value will always start from zero when downloading, even in resume mode.</p>
<p>The Index field can be monitored for changes so that progress during send and receive transmissions can be tracked.</p>

      <description>
<p>HTTP content can be streamed from a source file when a <code>POST</code> command is executed. To do so, set the InputFile field to the file path that contains the source data.  The path is not opened or checked for validity until the <code>POST</code> command is executed by the HTTP object.</p>
<p>An alternative is to set the <fl>InputObject</fl> for abstracting the data source.</p>

      <description>
<p>The URI of the HTTP source must be specified here.  The string must start with <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code>, followed by the host name, HTTP path and port number if required. The values mentioned will be broken down and stored in the <fl>Host</fl>, <fl>Path</fl> and <fl>Port</fl> fields respectively.  Note that if the port is not defined in the URI, the <fl>Port</fl> field is reset to the default (<code>80</code> for HTTP or <code>443</code> for HTTPS).</p>
<p>An alternative to setting the Location is to set the <fl>Host</fl>, <fl>Path</fl> and <fl>Port</fl> separately.</p>

      <description>
<p>This field is relevant when the <fl>OutputObject</fl> field has been set for receiving incoming data. The method of communication used against the target object can be defined through the ObjectMode. The default setting is <code>DATA::FEED</code>, which passes data through the data feed system (see also the <fl>Datatype</fl> to define the type of data being sent to the object).  The alternative method is <code>READ_WRITE</code>, which uses the Write action to send data to the targeted object.</p>

      <comment>Outgoing data can be managed using a function callback if this field is set.</comment>
      <access read="G" write="S">Get/Set</access>
      <type>FUNCTION</type>
      <description>
<p>Outgoing data can be managed manually by providing the HTTP object with an outgoing callback routine.  The C prototype for the callback routine is <code>ERR Function(*HTTP, APTR Buffer, LONG BufferSize, LONG *Result)</code>.  For Fluid use <code>function(HTTP, Buffer, BufferSize)</code>.</p>
<p>Outgoing content is placed in the <code>Buffer</code> address and must not exceed the indicated <code>BufferSize</code>.  The total number of bytes placed in the <code>Buffer</code> must be indicated in the Result parameter before the callback routine returns.</p>
<p>If an error code of <code>ERR::Terminate</code> is returned by the callback routine, any remaining data will be sent and the transfer will be treated as having completed successfully.  Use <code>ERR::TimeOut</code> if data cannot be returned in a reasonable time frame.  All other error codes apart from <code>ERR::Okay</code> indicate failure.</p>

<p>Prior to the execution of a <code>POST</code> command it is recommended that you set the Size field to explicitly define the length of the data transfer.  If this field is not set, the HTTP object will attempt to determine the byte size of the transfer by reading the size from the source file or object.</p>

      <description>
<p>Define a callback routine in StateChanged in order to receive notifications of any change to the <fl>CurrentState</fl> of an HTTP object.  The format for the routine is <code>ERR Function(*HTTP, HGS State)</code>.</p>
<p>If an error code of <code>ERR::Terminate</code> is returned by the callback routine, the currently executing HTTP request will be cancelled.</p>

      <description>
<p>A username can be preset before executing an HTTP method against a secure server zone.  The supplied credentials will only be passed to the HTTP server if it asks for authorisation.  The username provided should be accompanied by a <fl>Password</fl>.</p>
<p>In the event that a username or password is not supplied, or if the supplied credentials are invalid, the user will be presented with a dialog box and asked to enter the correct username and password.</p>
