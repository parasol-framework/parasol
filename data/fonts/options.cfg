# Font options in this file will add/overwrite values in fonts.cfg, which is machine generated.
# The fonts.cfg file can be refreshed by deleting it, then running any program that uses the Parasol UI.
#
# Hinting options for scalable fonts are as follows.  Please pay close attention to kerning results when adjusting the
# hinting of a font.
#
#  Normal:   The hinting information provided by the font should be given preference.
#  Internal: The Freetype hinter should be used and font specific hinting can be ignored (generally not recommended).
#  Light:    The light version of the Freetype hinter should be used (apply internal hinting on the Y axis only).
#
# If the vertical spacing of a font is inadequate, you can adjust it by setting LineSpacing with a multiplier value.
