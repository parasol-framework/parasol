# Contributions

Parasol is an open source, open community project. If you'd like to contribute to this project then please do so via the [GitHub](https://github.com/team-parasol/parasol/) repository. Create a branch for your work and then make a pull request targeting the develop branch in order to have the changes accepted.

New contributors should commit code under the `submit` branch with a suitable name that relates to an existing folder or relevant subject.  For example:

```
submit/core
submit/widget/window
submit/scripts-yourname
...
```

Code that is ready to be tested is pushed to the `test` branch.  If the automated tests are passed then the code can be pushed to the master branch.  From here it will eventually make its way to the next `release` branch for public distribution.

The majority of developers should use the `master` branch as the base-line for general project development as this is intended to be stable.
