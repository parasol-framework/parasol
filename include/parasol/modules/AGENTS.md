All headers in this folder are automatically generated by compiling `.fdl` files.  Headers are typically named after the module that they originate from.

Do not modify any of the files in this folder.  Instead, you should modify the source of the header (the appropriate FDL file) and then regenerate the header by triggering a cmake build.
